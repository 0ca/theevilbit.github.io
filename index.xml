      <description>I started to explore to possibility of persisting on macOS through script files contained in an application. The basic idea is that if we find a script file, which is being executed by a given application, we can edit that script file, put our code inside, and wait for an execution. Such technique is highly dependent on the applications the user has installed, so I looked through first how rare / frequent is having such scripts inside applications.</description>

      <title>VMware Fusion 11 - Guest VM RCE - CVE-2019-5514</title>

      <description>TL;DR You can run an arbitrary command on a VMware Fusion guest VM through a website without any priory knowledge. Basically VMware Fusion is starting up a websocket listening only on the localhost. You can fully control all the VMs (also create/delete snapshots, whatever you want) through this websocket interface, including launching apps. You need to have VMware Tools installed on the guest for launching apps, but honestly who doesnâ€™t have it installed.</description>
