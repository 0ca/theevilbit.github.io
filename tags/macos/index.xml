      <description>This writeup is intended to be a bit of storytelling. I would like to show how I went down the rabbit hole in a quick ’research’ I wanted to do, and eventually found a local privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS. I also want to show, tell about all the obstacles and failures I run into, stuff that people don’t talk about usually, but I feel it’s part of the process all of us go through, when we try to create something.</description>

      <title>GNS3 ubridge SETUID bit - arbitrary file read</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I had the idea of scanning my Mac for files that has the SUID bit set, I wanted to see if there is anything interesting showing up. You can do it this way:
/usr/bin/sudo find / -perm -4000 -exec /bin/ls -ldb {} \; &amp;gt; suidfilelist There was one item that caught my attention, and that was a file called ubridge inside GNS3. I used to be a network guy, and GNS3 is a great tool to emulate real network gear, practice configuration, etc.</description>

      <title>macOS - Persisting through Application script files</title>

      <description>I started to explore to possibility of persisting on macOS through script files contained in an application. The basic idea is that if we find a script file, which is being executed by a given application, we can edit that script file, put our code inside, and wait for an execution. Such technique is highly dependent on the applications the user has installed, so I looked through first how rare / frequent is having such scripts inside applications.</description>
