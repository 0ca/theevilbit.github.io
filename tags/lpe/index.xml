      <description>After my recent blog post, my old mate @_Dark_Knight_ reached out to me and he asked me a question:
 “Do you typically callout user apps that allow dyld_insert_libraries?”
 And a few similar ones, and I will be honest, I had no idea what is he talking about, if only I understood the question :D Despite the fact that my recent blog posts and talks are about macOS, I deal much more with Windows on a daily basis, probably like 95%, and macOS is still a whole new territory for me.</description>

      <description>This writeup is intended to be a bit of storytelling. I would like to show how I went down the rabbit hole in a quick ’research’ I wanted to do, and eventually found a local privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS. I also want to show, tell about all the obstacles and failures I run into, stuff that people don’t talk about usually, but I feel it’s part of the process all of us go through, when we try to create something.</description>
