      <description>Many people used to ask me where to start learning about macOS security or exploitation, what are the trainings or books out there that can help with this topic. Surprisingly there is great coverage for macOS internals and defense, which are even recent vs exploitation, where everything is 9+ years old. If you are interested in offensive macOS research, you are stuck with blog posts and conference talks.
I thought I will try to collect some resources that can help people to get started in this field.</description>
