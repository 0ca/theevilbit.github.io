      <description>I started to explore to possibility of persisting on macOS through script files contained in an application. The basic idea is that if we find a script file, which is being executed by a given application, we can edit that script file, put our code inside, and wait for an execution. Such technique is highly dependent on the applications the user has installed, so I looked through first how rare / frequent is having such scripts inside applications.</description>
