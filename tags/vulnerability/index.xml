      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I had the idea of scanning my Mac for files that has the SUID bit set, I wanted to see if there is anything interesting showing up. You can do it this way:
/usr/bin/sudo find / -perm -4000 -exec /bin/ls -ldb {} \; &amp;gt; suidfilelist There was one item that caught my attention, and that was a file called ubridge inside GNS3. I used to be a network guy, and GNS3 is a great tool to emulate real network gear, practice configuration, etc.</description>

      <description>TL;DR You can run an arbitrary command on a VMware Fusion guest VM through a website without any priory knowledge. Basically VMware Fusion is starting up a websocket listening only on the localhost. You can fully control all the VMs (also create/delete snapshots, whatever you want) through this websocket interface, including launching apps. You need to have VMware Tools installed on the guest for launching apps, but honestly who doesnâ€™t have it installed.</description>
