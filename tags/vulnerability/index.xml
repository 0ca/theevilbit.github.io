      <description>IOBit’s Unlocker program is advertised to solve the following issues:
 IObit Unlocker performs well in solving “cannot delete files”, “access is denied”, “The file is in use by another program or user”, or “There has been a sharing violation” problems. With IObit Unlocker, you can manage all your files the way you want.
 and even:
 With “Unlock &amp;amp; Delete”, “Unlock &amp;amp; Rename”, “Unlock &amp;amp; Move”, and “Unlock &amp;amp; Copy”, IObit Unlocker offers easier ways to unlock and manage the files and folders to keep them safe and available.</description>

      <title>macOS - Getting root with benign AppStore apps</title>

      <description>This writeup is intended to be a bit of storytelling. I would like to show how I went down the rabbit hole in a quick ’research’ I wanted to do, and eventually found a local privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS. I also want to show, tell about all the obstacles and failures I run into, stuff that people don’t talk about usually, but I feel it’s part of the process all of us go through, when we try to create something.</description>

      <title>GNS3 ubridge SETUID bit - arbitrary file read</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I had the idea of scanning my Mac for files that has the SUID bit set, I wanted to see if there is anything interesting showing up. You can do it this way:
/usr/bin/sudo find / -perm -4000 -exec /bin/ls -ldb {} \; &amp;gt; suidfilelist There was one item that caught my attention, and that was a file called ubridge inside GNS3. I used to be a network guy, and GNS3 is a great tool to emulate real network gear, practice configuration, etc.</description>

      <title>VMware Fusion 11 - Guest VM RCE - CVE-2019-5514</title>

      <description>TL;DR You can run an arbitrary command on a VMware Fusion guest VM through a website without any priory knowledge. Basically VMware Fusion is starting up a websocket listening only on the localhost. You can fully control all the VMs (also create/delete snapshots, whatever you want) through this websocket interface, including launching apps. You need to have VMware Tools installed on the guest for launching apps, but honestly who doesn’t have it installed.</description>
