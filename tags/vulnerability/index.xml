      <title>Secure coding XPC Services - Part 5 - PID reuse attacks</title>

      <description>In the last post of the series we will see another typical issue, where XPC services using the connecting process&amp;rsquo;s ID (PID) to verify the client instead of the audit token. We will use F-Secure SAFE again for our case study, the vulnerability was fixed in 17.8.
The root cause The XPC services of F-Secure SAFE use the process ID (PID) to verify the client&amp;rsquo;s signature, as can be seen in the code below.</description>

      <title>Secure coding XPC Services - Part 4 - Improved client authorization</title>

      <description>F-Secure SAFE XPC service exploitation Intro In this post we will look into an other case study which will show us (again) why XPC client verification is crucial in XPC security, and how added authorization checks can slightly improve (but not fix) the problem. The F-Secure SAFE XPC services installed on macOS were not sufficiently hardened, and a malicious actor had the ability to interact with them. The vulnerability was fixed in version 17.</description>

      <title>Secure coding XPC Services - Part 3 - Incorrect client verification</title>

      <description>Microsoft AutoUpdate macOS privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2020-0984) Introduction This is the third post in my series which is trying to help Apple developers to avoid typical insecure coding practices. This one will highlight why XPC client hardening and proper verification is extremely important when we use XPC messaging on macOS between clients that run as a normal user and services that run as root. If this validation is not right, it opens up the possibility for an attacker to run privileged commands or worse case, achieve full privilege escalation on the system.</description>

      <title>Exploiting directory permissions on macOS</title>

      <description>This research started around summer time in 2019, when everything settled down after my talk in 2019, where I detailed how did I gained root privileges via a benign App Store application, that I developed. That exploit used a symlink to achieve this, so I though I will make a more general approach and see if this type of vulnerability exists in other places as well on macOS systems. As it turns out it does exists, and not just on macOS directly but also on other apps, it appears to be a very fruitful of issue, without too much effort I found 5 exploitable bugs on macOS, 3 in Adobe installers.</description>

      <title>IOBit Unlocker 1.1.2 - Local Privilege Escalation</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/iobit_unlocker_lpe/</link>

      <description>IOBit’s Unlocker program is advertised to solve the following issues:
 IObit Unlocker performs well in solving “cannot delete files”, “access is denied”, “The file is in use by another program or user”, or “There has been a sharing violation” problems. With IObit Unlocker, you can manage all your files the way you want.
 and even:
 With “Unlock &amp;amp; Delete”, “Unlock &amp;amp; Rename”, “Unlock &amp;amp; Move”, and “Unlock &amp;amp; Copy”, IObit Unlocker offers easier ways to unlock and manage the files and folders to keep them safe and available.</description>

      <title>macOS - Getting root with benign AppStore apps</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/getting_root_with_benign_appstore_apps/</link>

      <description>This writeup is intended to be a bit of storytelling. I would like to show how I went down the rabbit hole in a quick ’research’ I wanted to do, and eventually found a local privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS. I also want to show, tell about all the obstacles and failures I run into, stuff that people don’t talk about usually, but I feel it’s part of the process all of us go through, when we try to create something.</description>

      <title>GNS3 ubridge SETUID bit - arbitrary file read</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I had the idea of scanning my Mac for files that has the SUID bit set, I wanted to see if there is anything interesting showing up. You can do it this way:
/usr/bin/sudo find / -perm -4000 -exec /bin/ls -ldb {} \; &amp;gt; suidfilelist There was one item that caught my attention, and that was a file called ubridge inside GNS3. I used to be a network guy, and GNS3 is a great tool to emulate real network gear, practice configuration, etc.</description>

      <title>VMware Fusion 11 - Guest VM RCE - CVE-2019-5514</title>
      <link>https://theevilbit.github.io/posts/vmware_fusion_11_guest_vm_rce_cve-2019-5514/</link>

      <description>TL;DR You can run an arbitrary command on a VMware Fusion guest VM through a website without any priory knowledge. Basically VMware Fusion is starting up a websocket listening only on the localhost. You can fully control all the VMs (also create/delete snapshots, whatever you want) through this websocket interface, including launching apps. You need to have VMware Tools installed on the guest for launching apps, but honestly who doesn’t have it installed.</description>
