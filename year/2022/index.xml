      <description>This is part 28 in the series of &amp;ldquo;Beyond the good ol&#39; LaunchAgents&amp;rdquo;, where I try to collect various persistence techniques for macOS. For more background check the introduction.
 This persistence mechanism was described in very detail by Chris Ross in his blogpost: Persistent Credential Theft with Authorization Plugins. He also developed sample code, which can be found on his GitHub. Thus this blog will only focus on the high level summary, and some changes that happened since he wrote that post.</description>

 This persistence is another gem I found in Leo Pitt&amp;rsquo;s Modern macOS Persistence talk.
macOS Dock stores shortcuts for applications, that we would like to access through the, well&amp;hellip; Dock. It stores all settings in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist. Although we can edit this PLIST directly, we can also use the defaults utility to change it.</description>

      <description>This is part 26 in the series of &amp;ldquo;Beyond the good ol&#39; LaunchAgents&amp;rdquo;, where I try to collect various persistence techniques for macOS. For more background check the introduction.
 This method was documented very detailed by Patrick Wardle in his blogpost back in 2016. It was also covered by Leo Pitt in his Modern macOS Persistence talk, and he also made a POC, which can be found at his GitHub.</description>
