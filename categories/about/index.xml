      <description>My name is Csaba Fitzl or also known as &amp;ldquo;theevilbit&amp;rdquo;, which comes from RFC 3514. I currently work as a red teamer at a Big Oil company, but I also worked 5 years as blue teamer, and also spent 6 years building network infrastructure, and mostly having fun with BGP.
This is the new place for my blog, the old one is here: https://theevilbit.blogspot.com/
